**Expression Evaluation**: Compute the result of a given arithmetic expression.
**Odd/Even Check**: Program to determine if a number is odd or even.
**Multiplication Table**: Display the multiplication table for a given number.
**Divisibility Check**: Find numbers between 2000 and 3200 divisible by 7 but not multiples of 5.
**Data Type Counting**: Count occurrences of each data type in a list.
**Sum of Numeric Values**: Add all numeric values in a list.
**String Concatenation**: Concatenate string elements using a hyphen.
**Custom UDF**: Create a function that sums numbers (excluding booleans) and counts strings in a list.
**Odd Numbers Extraction**: Extract odd numbers using loops, list comprehensions, and lambda functions.
**Descriptive Statistics**: Create a function to return the sum, count, min, mean, and max of a list.
**Area Calculation**: Write a UDF to calculate the area of different shapes with appropriate validation.
**List Reconciliation**: Compare two lists and return matched, only-in-first, and only-in-second elements.
**Prime Check**: Create a function to determine if a number is prime.
**Factorial Calculation**: Program to compute the factorial of a given number.
**Square Dictionary**: Generate a dictionary where keys are numbers and values are their squares.
**List and Tuple Creation**: Convert a sequence of comma-separated numbers into a list and a tuple.
**Word Sorting**: Accept and sort a sequence of words alphabetically.
**Duplicate Removal**: Remove duplicates from a sequence of words and sort them.
